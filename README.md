Frogger - Part of Udacity's front end nano-degree
===============================

## A classic arcade game built with object-orientated Javascipt.

I built this game to practice writing object-orientated javascript. app.js, the css and html is my own code, while resources.js and engine.js (apart from some tweaks) were provided by Udacity. 

To play the game, simply click the link next to repo decription, or download the repo and open index.html in your browser. The game uses keyboard input, so users use keyboard arrows to move the player around the board, collecting points and avoinding enemies.
